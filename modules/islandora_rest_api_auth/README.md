# Islandora API Rest Auth

## Introduction

Allows Islandora REST to take configurable user tokens for authentication.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora REST](https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_rest)

## Installation

Install as usual, see 
[this](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for 
further information.

## Configuration

Users with access to use Islandora REST will have a place present on their user
page: My account Â» Edit (user/uidoftheuser/edit) to enter a token to
authenticate against. This token is salted using the same mechanism as Drupal
passwords and stored.

## Usage

To authenticate for a REST request the user needs to provide a Basic
Authorization Header that specifies their username and the token.
NOTE: For Basic Authorization the username and token are separated by a colon
and then base64 encoded.

For example:
```
GET /islandora/rest/v1/object/islandora:root HTTP/1.1
Host: an.example.host
Authorization: Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0
```

Or as a cURL command (object deletion):
```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0" -v
http://pathtothebox/islandora/rest/v1/object/islandora:root
```

## Troubleshooting/Issues

A limitation currently exists when setting authtokens where they will only ever
be applied to the currently-logged-in user. This includes attempting to set an
authtoken for another user on their "Edit" page. This will be addressed in the
future, but for now, authtokens can only be created for a user when they are
logged in and looking at their own "Edit" page.
